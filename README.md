# Jaded-Journey
A game created for a four-hour game jam competition against [Matt Vorsteg](https://github.com/mvorsteg) and [Jordan Woo](https://github.com/minersail), judged by [Tim Henderson](https://github.com/timhenderson17) and [John Ball](https://github.com/jlball), that took place on December 5, 2020. Very simple, completely unpolished. Went for development speed over quality. Won first place in the game jam.
